I'm addicted to his powerful books:《relentless》——from good to great to unstoppable,
《winning》,《jumping head》》. Because his books make me deeply feel and intrigued by
this sentence "阅读是一种伤害，思考是一种弥合；reading is a kind of hurt/damage, relecting is a ;"
Please enjoy its contents:

**1，Don't Think** 


**2，The Cleaner You Are, the Dirtier You Get**

**3，When You're a Cleaner,You keep pushing yourself harder when everyone else has had enough.**

**4，You get into the Zone, shut out everything else, and control the uncontrollable.**

**5，You know exactly who you are.**

**6，You have a dark side that refuses to be taught to be good.**

**7，You're not intimidated by pressure, you thrive on it**

**8，When everyone is hitting the"In Case of Emergency" button, they're all looking for you**

**9，You don't compete with anyone, you find your opponent's weakness and you attack**

He just make me come into this idea: reading, writing, learning and teaching yourself doesn't need me, or anyone who feel uncomfortable with his life, but anyone who would rather shoulder the responsibility for achieving the greater good than enduring the daily trifles, nonsense, unnecessary misery. 

Indeed, nothing is completely comfortable, passively accept the trifles and tasks from others, endure the endless and tedious life, how shallow and stupid it is. Instead, proavtively challenging the greater good, and keep various methods to achieve, and you would harvest far less than what you sow.

**You make decisions,not suggestions; you know the answer while everyone else is still asking questions**

**You don't have to love the work, but you're addicted to the results.**

This word just remind the similar chinese "强者谈习惯，弱者谈喜欢"。Results and goal-oriented
instead of methods and procedure-oriented. 

**"BOttom line if you want success of any kind: you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable."**, I regard it as the chinese "工作就是辛苦的，就没有轻松的工作，如果有，那么它就是娱乐"

**You'd rather be feared than liked.**

**You trust very few people, and those you trust better never let you down. **

**You don't reognize failure; you know there's more than one way to get what you want.**

**You don't celebrate your achievements because you always want more.**
